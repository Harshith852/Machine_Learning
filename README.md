# Machine Learning Repository  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! This is a collection of machine learning models and techniques that I learn and implement during my journey of mastering machine learning concepts.  

## Repository Structure  

This repository is organized into categories based on the type of learning and modeling techniques:  

### 1. **Supervised Learning**  
#### Classification  
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Naive Bayes  
- Random Forest  

#### Regression  
- Linear Regression  

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
(*More to come as I explore!*)  

## Future Additions  
As I continue learning, I will keep adding more models and concepts, including:  
- Advanced algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning  
- Neural networks and deep learning techniques  
- Reinforcement learning  

## Getting Started  

Feel free to explore the code files for each model. Each implementation contains:  
- **Code**: Python implementation of the model  
- **Datasets**: Relevant datasets used (when applicable)  
- **Documentation**: Notes and explanations to understand the approach  

## Contributing  
If you'd like to contribute, suggest improvements, or share insights, feel free to fork this repo and raise a pull request.
